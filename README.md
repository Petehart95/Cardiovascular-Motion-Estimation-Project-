## Developing an Accurate Motion Estimation Algorithm within the Field of Cardiovascular Image Processing

The following project reviews the development of a motion estimation algorithm which could 
be applied within the field of cardiovascular image processing, this is effectively accomplished 
by utilising a speckle tracking technique in combination with a block matching motion 
estimation algorithm. This algorithm was then applied a data collection comprising of different 
examples of cardiovascular patient data, whereby the motion estimation algorithmâ€™s capability 
was established based on an average velocity plot which described the average velocity of the 
motion that was detected between frames of the ultrasound image throughout the entire cardiac 
cycle. It is hoped that this project will produce useful analytical data which can be used by 
clinicians with the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with cardiovascular related concerns. 
Overall, the outcome of this project concluded with the motion of the cardiomyocytes being 
detected and tracked effectively, though it should be noted that the developed solution still 
includes an amount of noisy motion vectors being unnecessarily tracked resulting in a slightly 
more obscured outcome.
