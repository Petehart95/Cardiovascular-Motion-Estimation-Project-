# Parallel Cardiac Image Processing Project

Artefact - To Do:

0. Experiment with OpenCL on MATLAB and C++

1. Create an initial parallel version of the currently serial version of the block motion-estimation algorithm
2. Reduce the amount of noise being accumulated in the algorithm
3. Ensure that the average velocity estimation calculation is done in cm/s as opposed to px/s
4. Improve image processing techniques so that only the myocardium movement is tracked
5. Compare different parallel processing techniques
6. Compare those parallel processing techniques on different block motion estimation techniques
