## An Investigation into the Prominence and Accuracy of Block-Matching Motion Estimation Algorithms within the Application of Medical Image Processing

###Artefact - To Do:
1. Amend average velocity vector calculation -done
2. Remove noise in the DICOM image by comparing each velocity vector with the average velocity vector
3. Improve three-step search algorithm -> allow loop to be broke if the best kernel is the centre kernel
4. Use region detection to crop the LV and LVT within the image

###Dissertation - To Do:
1. [Introduction] Add more regarding the background of the project and how it can be argued to be academically justified. 
2. [Introduction] Reword objective/aim descriptions as appropriate
3. [Literature Review] Re-implement previously discussed literature from the project proposal
4. [Literature Review] Try and find at least 10 more sources for the literature review
5. [Acknowledgements] Quickly do this section
6. [Cover Page] Edit cover page layout as appropriate, see more examples of past dissertations.
