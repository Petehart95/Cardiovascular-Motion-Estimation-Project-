# Parallel Cardiac Image Processing Project | Third Year Project | Supervisor: Dr. Massoud Zolgharni
## An Investigation into the Prominence of Parallelisation with a Block-Matching Motion Estimation Algorithm for Cardiac Image Processing

####Artefact - To Do:
1. Experiment with OpenCL on MATLAB and C++
2. Create an initial parallel version of the currently serial version of the block motion-estimation algorithm
3. Reduce the amount of noise being accumulated in the algorithm
4. Ensure that the average velocity estimation calculation is done in cm/s as opposed to px/s
5. Improve image processing techniques so that only the myocardium movement is tracked
6. Compare different parallel processing techniques
7. Compare those parallel processing techniques on different block motion estimation techniques

####Dissertation - To Do:
1. [Introduction] Add more regarding the background of the project and how it can be argued to be academically justified. 
2. [Introduction] Reword objective/aim descriptions as appropriate
3. [Literature Review] Re-implement previously discussed literature from the project proposal
4. [Literature Review] Try and find at least 10 more sources for the literature review
5. [Acknowledgements] Quickly do this section
6. [Cover Page] Edit cover page layout as appropriate, see more examples of past dissertations.
